### Idea

When me and my brother were little, we used to come up with ideas for different games with what we had available to us. One of those was a game where the goal was to hit and knock off all caps of the opponent. Those caps were all Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite caps which all had their own colors. This game was played on a chessboard.

#### Rules

- The playing field is the same as the chessboard (for now) and split into two sections, one for each player
- Each side gets 9 pieces and they can spread them as they want on their side
- A player tries to hit the opponent's cap by flicking their own cap, and the goal is to knock it off the playing field.
- You can only hit your own cap
- Game ends when only one player's caps remain on the board

#### Tasks

- [ ] Visualize the board in such a way that it's easier for players to make sense of their situation
- [ ] Figure out the physics of caps hitting each other in a sort of a chain reaction. Like billiard balls.
- [ ] Figure out how the players will hit the caps visually. We can start with simply allowing players to set the force. 
- [ ] Music! Lofi or a bit more energetic?
- [ ] Allow players to pick avatars and make these avatars say something when they make a good move. You can use the freely available visual novel assets on itch.io. This can also just be a character that represents the game owner or something...like Toasty! from Mortal Kombat.
